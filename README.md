Intel has published a proposal for a new legacy-reduced architecture called
[x86S](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/776648) (PDF).  This
architecture is intended to simplify systems that for long have had no need for
real-mode execution or any other such thing.

This project is my attempt to run through what a minimial boot and kernel
process looks like in the new architecture.
